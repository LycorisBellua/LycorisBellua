### Hi there 👋

I'm Lycoris Bellua, an aspiring game dev. Nice to meet you!  

Long story short:
- I love 3D and VR.
- I'm curious about AR.
- And I love Unreal too.
- If you recruit for such a project, don't hesitate to slide in them ✨ DMs ✨ !
- While I love games, let's discover another field. What are you working on?
- I'm currently searching for a 6 month full-time contract for early 2026.
- It can be an internship or fixed-term, whichever works for you.
- If all goes well between us, this may lead to something long term.
